# give-health-get-forecast
This is a project to create, using Genomics Data Science, a forecast of what kind of country 
indicators we can get if we give only health indicators.
It is the intention of the creator to correlate this in a sense that we can demand a global
health care in order to really turn our planet into a one whole healthy organism, even if that
means not a global government.

We will use the public databank of the World Bank (accessed from South America at june 2018 @ http://databank.worldbank.org/),
choosing only the features we find interesting, not trying to be impartial, picking all the Countries listed, all the Series and
the years of 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013.

Ninety percent of the data set lessons will be our training set and the other tem percent will be the new lessons,
this is in order to check the fitness of our result function.
After new data is created, we can check how long we can sustain the function without creating a new generation function,
so the idea is to always keep checking it fitness and create flags so the algorithm can be updated.
